# CSE574-LETOR-Using-LinearRegression
We studied how to solve Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem using machine learning. 
LeTor is a problem in Information Retrieval. We devised this as a problem of linear regression where we map an input vector x to a real-valued scalar target y(x,w). 
Experiments on various hyper-parameters such as learning rate, number of basis function, regularization term were performed for their eï¬€ect on the accuracy of the program.
